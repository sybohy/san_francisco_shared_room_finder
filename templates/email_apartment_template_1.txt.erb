Hi!

I just saw your apartment listing on Craigslist and was wondering if I could come by to check it out today or this weekend?

I'm moving from SoCal for a new job in SF. I have a small dog (less than 10 lbs) named Lilly who's really obedient and quiet. I think I'd be a good fit and would love to come check the place out.

Thank You!
